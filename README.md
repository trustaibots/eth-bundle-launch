# Eth-Bundle-Launch v1.1
**Ethereum Token Bundle Launch Project**

This project will perform an bundle token launch of ERC-20. This will be done by 3 steps
1. Token Contract deployment
2. Estimate the required ETHs for each buyer wallets
3. Configure and launch script

## 1. Token Contract deployment

The project has two main components, one is the script and another is the smart contract. 

### Steps to Customize the Smart Contract:

Navigate to either contracts/contract-mainnet.sol or contracts/contract-sepolia.sol, depending on your target network:

- contract-mainnet.sol: Contract for Ethereum Mainnet
- contract-sepolia.sol: Contract for Ethereum Sepolia Testnet

The only difference between these contracts is the Uniswap V2 router address specified in the code.
Customize the contract as needed to fit your requirements.

### Deploy the Smart Contract

- Use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to deploy the contract

Once deployed, ensure that:
- You have transferred ETH to the contract. This ETH will serve as the amount for initial liquidity.
- You have transferred tokens to the contract. These tokens will also be used for initial liquidity.

### Updating the ABI

If any function or variable names in the contract are modified:

- Download the updated ABI JSON file using Etherscan or Remix.
- Replace the file located at src/abi/token-abi.json with the new ABI JSON file.

## 2. Estimate the required ETHs for each buyer wallets

Use python script ./calculate_eth_for_wallets.py on Ubuntu

- Install python3

apt install python3

- Modify parameters

// Parameters in calculate_eth_for_wallets.py
...
initial_eth = 2.0	// ETHs in initial liquidity 
initial_tokens = 100    // Tokens in initial liquidity (100 is fine, no need to change this parameter)
num_wallets = 50 	// Wallet count to be used as buyers
target_percentage = 80  // Token hold percentage by sniping
...

- Execute the python script

python3 calculate_eth_for_wallets.py

Execution results are
```bash
Wallet 1: Needs 0.0325 ETH
Wallet 2: Needs 0.0336 ETH
Wallet 3: Needs 0.0347 ETH

...

Wallet 49: Needs 0.6386 ETH
Wallet 50: Needs 0.7407 ETH
Total ETH required by all wallets: 8.0000 ETH
```

## 3. Configure and launch script

### Configure 

Navigate src/config.ts and configure the script

```ts
export const MAINNET_RPC= "https://boldest-bold-uranium.quiknode.pro/a5e9ce66d6648e49889274a783acd07aebcc02bc/"
// Replace this with your mainnet rpc
export const SEPOLIA_RPC="https://old-green-glade.ethereum-sepolia.quiknode.pro/0523b575936957f0e7eae638096d19465aae8f8c/"
// Replace this with your sepolia testnet rpc

export const FLASHBOTS_ENDPOINT="https://relay.flashbots.net"
export const SEPOLIA_FLASHBOTS_ENDPOINT="https://relay-sepolia.flashbots.net"
export const VERSION = 1.0

// Ethereum = 1,
// Sepolia = 11155111
export const NET_MODE = 11155111             // Set the chain ID to specify whether to launch on Mainnet or Testnet
export const OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY = "af264be3f6a97b5ef1f19b675e2fe84ed15fd726ba38e59c5468d95f53f6de71"; 
// Replace this with your own private key.

export const BRIBE_PAYER_KEY = "a36d14d380505993394deef92e13d079e1e0053b0f294939d4679c5d3d80671c"; 
// Replace this with the private key of the bribe payer.

export const BUYER_PRIVATE_KEY = [
    "2cc095269dc37126b5df0307534ae78a5c4287459041d3fc3d83225def084b28", // Replace with buyer wallet private keys.
    "c50f78fcc2f162e2c02ae24372d52e11c79b0fe4f7ed00ffd7d6ed623b14f641", // ...
    "c50f78fcc2f162e2c02ae24372d52e11c79b0fe4f7ed00ffd7d6ed623b14f641", // ...
    // Add more keys as needed...
    "c50f78fcc2f162e2c02ae24372d52e11c79b0fe4f7ed00ffd7d6ed623b14f641", // ...
    "6acd8aa799d644271af6ce326648ba4c4d6da1dc1ba905cd70d3525a4d2a9537", // ...
];

export const BUY_AMOUNT = [
    "0.0325", // Replace with the calculated ETH amount per wallet from result of calculate_eth_for_wallets.py.
    "0.0336", // ...
    "0.0347", // ...
    // Add more amounts as needed...
    "0.6386", // ...
    "0.7407", // ...
];

export const TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0xcf1e7Df33a0Cb3046D56B17a5B7b30EA25c2fd44"; 
// Replace with the address of your deployed token contract.

export const BRIBE_AMOUNT = 0.1; 
// Set the bribe amount to be used with the flashbots provider.

```

### Launch preparation

- Ensure that all the wallets (Deployer, Briber, and Buyer) have enough balance to cover the transaction fees for sniping the tokens.

Deployer Wallet: Must have enough balance to cover the transaction fee for executing the ```openTrading``` function in the token contract.
Briber Wallet: Must have enough ETH to transfer the bribe and cover the associated transaction fee.
Buyer Wallets: Each buyer wallet must have enough ETH to purchase tokens, along with the transaction fee required for the token swap.

- Confirm that no liquidity pool already exists for the token contract.
- Make sure that ETH and tokens have already been transferred to the token contract address.
- Verify that the amount of tokens each buyer intends to purchase does not exceed the max-transaction limit. If necessary, adjust the ETH balance in the buyer wallets to accommodate the swap.

### Launch the script 

#### Run the following commands
```
> npm install
```

#### To start the script:
```
npm start
```

### Note: If you have renamed the 'openTrading' function in the contract, make sure to update the name in the snipe.ts file as well.

```ts
let estimatedGas
const openTradingData = token_contract.methods.openTrading() // Update the function name here to match the changes in your contract. Ensure the ABI is also updated as mentioned earlier.

try {
    estimatedGas = await openTradingData.estimateGas({
```

Always double-check that the ABI (```abi/token-abi.json```) is updated to reflect any changes in the contract before proceeding.
